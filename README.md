# bashScripts

Some random bash scripts I made for various things

directories:

* configs: files i use to save my settings like bashrc and vimrc
	(used with symlinks)
* utils: some bash scripts that do some useful things
	(folder in PATH)
* setupscripts: scripts that install various things
	(including a script that makes the links for my config files)
